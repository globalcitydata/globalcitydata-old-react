        The global city data project seeks to create an open, federated platform
        where urban sustainability researchers and practitioners anywhere in the
        world can showcase their peer­reviewed urban datasets and models to the
        community at large. We seek to feature diverse urban datasets in one
        place, drawing upon studies from various regions of the world, covering
        many different determinants, sectors and sustainability outcomes, and
        incorporating the perspectives of many diverse disciplines. So you will
        see data elements representing many aspects of sustainable urban systems
        ­ human, social, ecological, infrastructural, technological, and
        political. A unique feature is that we have organized the datasets
        according to three spatial scales ­ intra­urban datasets, aggregate
        data/metrics for individual cities, and data across all urban areas in a
        nation.

        This website is not a data repository but rather a collaborative
        platform for learning about available data sets and/or featuring your
        own data and models. More detail about each data product can be seen in
        the data briefs, including information to contact the authors directly
        to request more detail or further access to the data. We hope you will
        enjoy browsing the available datasets and models, contribute your own
        work after it is peer­reviewed, and blog about best practices in the
        development or use of urban data and models to advance sustainability
        outcomes in communities.

        This data project was initiated in 2017 by Professor Anu Ramaswami when
        she served as lead Principal Investigator of three US National Science
        Foundation grants on sustainable urban infrastructure. Ramaswami saw the
        need for a comprehensive website that collated and featured many
        different urban datasets and models in one easily browsable platform,
        while each of the individual authors retained autonomy over their data
        products.
      </p>

        This collaborative data showcasing platform is managed by a committee of
        6 researchers (faculty and students) who have contributed datasets or
        models to the website. We look forward to getting your feedback on how
        to make this more useful to researchers and practitioners alike.
